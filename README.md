# TIL-25 Data Chefs - Computer Vision Challenge

**Hackathon:** TIL-25 Hackathon
**Team:** Data Chefs
**Author:** lolkabash

## üìñ Description

This repository contains the solution for the Computer Vision (CV) challenge as part of the TIL-25 Hackathon. The project involved [**Specify the CV task, e.g., image classification, object detection, image segmentation, etc.**].

## üíª Technologies Used

*   **Jupyter Notebook:** For experimentation, model development, and visualization.
*   **Python:** Core programming language for model implementation and scripting.
*   **PowerShell/Shell Scripts:** For automation tasks, data management, or environment setup.
*   **(Mention specific CV libraries/frameworks used, e.g., OpenCV, Pillow, Scikit-image, TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, YOLO, Detectron2.)**
*   **(Mention other key Python libraries, e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.)**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Working Process & Solution

This section outlines the general steps taken to address the Computer Vision challenge.

### 1. Data Collection & Preparation
*   **Dataset Used:** (Describe the dataset(s) used. E.g., COCO, ImageNet, Pascal VOC, or a custom dataset. Mention size, image types, number of classes.)
*   **Preprocessing:** (Detail the steps taken to prepare the images, e.g., resizing, normalization, data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, color jittering.)
*   **Annotation:** (If applicable, how were images annotated? E.g., bounding boxes for object detection, masks for segmentation. Tools used.)

### 2. Model Selection & Architecture
*   **Model Choice:** (Explain why a particular CV model or architecture was chosen for the task. E.g., ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet, YOLOv5, Mask R-CNN.)
*   **Architecture Details:** (Briefly describe the model architecture if it was custom or significantly modified.)
*   **Pre-trained Models:** (Specify if any pre-trained weights were used, e.g., models pre-trained on ImageNet.)

### 3. Training Process
*   **Environment Setup:** (Briefly mention the environment, e.g., local machine specs, cloud VM, GPU details, specific Python/library versions.)
*   **Training Configuration:** (Key hyperparameters, loss functions appropriate for the task, optimizers, batch size, number of epochs, learning rate schedulers.)
*   **Fine-tuning Strategy:** (If a pre-trained model was used, describe how it was fine-tuned.)
*   **Challenges Faced:** (Any significant challenges during training, e.g., overfitting, class imbalance, long training times, and how they were addressed.)

### 4. Evaluation
*   **Metrics Used:** (How was the model performance measured? E.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mAP (mean Average Precision) for object detection, IoU (Intersection over Union) for segmentation.)
*   **Validation Strategy:** (How was the model validated during training?)
*   **Test Set Performance:** (Results on the final, unseen test set.)

### 5. Results & Key Findings
*   **Final Model Performance:** (Summarize the best results achieved.)
*   **Insights:** (Any interesting insights gained from the model's predictions or the training process.)
*   **Visualizations:** (Consider linking to or embedding examples of model output, e.g., images with bounding boxes, segmentation masks, classification labels.)
